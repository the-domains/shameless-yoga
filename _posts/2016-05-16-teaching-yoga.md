Imagine walking into a room full of complete strangers with the knowledge that you will soon be guiding them through an ancient practice. This practice is the one unifying thread among everyone in the room, yet the expectations of what is about to occur still vary widely.

Some want to break a sweat and walk out of the room with the same euphoria that is achieved after a solid workout at the gym. Others want an hour that is optimized in such a way as to facilitate a sacred communion with the divine. 

There are those who have been practicing for longer than you've been alive, and those who will be practicing for the first time in their lives.
